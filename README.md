This is how the mobile money payment works, framework used is Sinatra. The process captured is depositing, withdrawing,
sending money and checking balance. Feel free to chip in and add buying airtime from your balance and taking a loan! We can pair
to do the remaining! 

My next plan will be to have an API of this, get in touch and we can figure all this out. Enjoy!
